<p>To fetch a twitching bird drizzling blood and kicking<br /> 
gravel but not really snow, hard slush and mud,<br />
hunters roll by slowly, orange blazing.<br />
The dusk and cold deepen as the sun sets, carrying<br />
a picture of me as a child with my address on its back.<br />
Not even ice that I made up frozen, but water<br />
clear and cold, whispering in dim culverts and<br />
in the woods, staying out of the light.<br />
I lie.<br />
But and only because my foul smell catches them.<br />
A pervert at the county fair took that picture when I was 12.<br />
Now Iâ€™m loose as thread thrown into bed and starlings<br />
break from the wires overhead.<br />
Boots bloody, I am snow lying in the ditches.<br />
I am not frozen.<br />
Only because my lying offends them.<br />
The hunters are young and I whisper to them, hiding<br />
in long shadows of trunks and limbs as they<br />
hop the barbed wire with the guns.<br />
He stomps back through the sedge, and then he is off,<br />
tossing the flecked grouse.<br />
And only because the muddy water running under me<br />
in the ditch in the orange dusk, road hunting<br />
for grouse, the noise of it running through my fingers,<br />
keeps them awake.<br /></p>
